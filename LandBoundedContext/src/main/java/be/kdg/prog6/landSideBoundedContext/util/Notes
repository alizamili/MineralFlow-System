ask the teacher when sending data back should you just send the domain
object or make like a class that mirror the domain without like id and call it queryObject

also can you make the warehouse manager in two places ?
in the landSide and the warehouse.
like what i have in the purcahseController i have a method for the warehouse manger and the rest is in the landside



    double materialWeight = command.startWeight() - command.endWeight();
======================================
stuff i need to do:
=======================
As a warehouse manager, I want to check if trucks arrive within the scheduled arrival
windows. Includes UI;

Lists of trucks (appoinments) for the current date with details like arrival window, seller,
status, license plate, mineral type,.... Trucks that are delayed are visually highlighted.
Another date can be picked.

=======================

● As a warehouse manager, I want to know how many trucks are on site so that in case of
emergency I know if there is anyone on site or not. Includes UI

for this user Story you dont need to create any class

you only need a controller and UseCase make new ones. that returns you data like a list about the trucks that are on site.
what i mean you return a list of all the trucks that are in the warehouse that did not leave yet.
what kind of data?
=======================

so what i need to do for this use story
● As a buyer, I want to send a PO to KDG to make sure they can expect a shipment soon.
is just make a api that tha recive data and create a PurchaseOrder and save it in the database.


so i PurchaseOrder is used when the seller try to store Mat so you make one when you want to Deliver to the warehouse . and also its used when the Ship try to like take matriles from the warehouse we look at the PurchaseOrder to see what can we give and also can we give it.






























































 # so what i understand is that the water side like send a command AKA an event to the warehouse
 # to say ok i want a material and than the warehouse would look at the oldest PDT ticket to find the oldest materials and like send an event back to the WATER side
 # also the PurchaseOrder should be in the WATER SIDE.
 # ask the teaher if the warehouse MANGER could be in the land SIDE

 #  PurchaseOrder is only the WAREHOUSE ? no landSIDE so i should remove my code in the land SIDE ?
 # what ist he difference between Shipping Orders with Purchase Orders




    # so the WATER side send a Shipment Order: it also has a attribute that link it to a Purchase Order:  the water send send the SHIPMENT ORDER
    # than the warehouse compare the shipment order against the Purchase Order: ?




    # so to sum up  the water side would send a command to the warehouse with a Shipment Order that Shipment Order also have is linked to a Purchase Order
    # the warehouse would compare  the  Purchase Order and the vessel number to the shipment order bease in the shipment order has id of the Purchase Order and a vessel number and some other attrubties . this is the IO OBJECT
    # i guess after this we would look at the OLDEST mat in the warehouse create an evetn to send it to the water side.that we are done.
    # maybe like also subtract the mat from the warehouse create like a WarehouseEvent.
    # dont i need the PTD ? because i dont have in anywhere  ? i do have a ActivityWindow and ActivityEvent.
    # the Shipment Order should be in the warehouse side and you should only create them using data.sql meanign create dummy data
    # the shipment order should be in the water side and also should only create them using the data.sql
    # the Shipment Order and the Purchase Order should match so when you create them in both sql make sure they match like the id and other attrubties values should match
    # so the water side should only have a vessial id like a record and shipment order class and a controller and a usercase
    # the controller will call the use can to publish event with the shipment order warehouse. so controller  +> calls core >+ core just publish shipment order event to the warehouse side


# find the people who are invloed in the eco problmes who create them who get affected by them.
