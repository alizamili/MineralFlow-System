ask the teacher when sending data back should you just send the domain
object or make like a class that mirror the domain without like id and call it queryObject

also can you make the warehouse manager in two places ?
in the landSide and the warehouse.
like what i have in the purcahseController i have a method for the warehouse manger and the rest is in the landside



    double materialWeight = command.startWeight() - command.endWeight();
======================================
stuff i need to do:
=======================
As a warehouse manager, I want to check if trucks arrive within the scheduled arrival
windows. Includes UI;

Lists of trucks (appoinments) for the current date with details like arrival window, seller,
status, license plate, mineral type,.... Trucks that are delayed are visually highlighted.
Another date can be picked.

=======================

● As a warehouse manager, I want to know how many trucks are on site so that in case of
emergency I know if there is anyone on site or not. Includes UI

for this user Story you dont need to create any class

you only need a controller and UseCase make new ones. that returns you data like a list about the trucks that are on site.
what i mean you return a list of all the trucks that are in the warehouse that did not leave yet.
what kind of data?
=======================

so what i need to do for this use story
● As a buyer, I want to send a PO to KDG to make sure they can expect a shipment soon.
is just make a api that tha recive data and create a PurchaseOrder and save it in the database.


so i PurchaseOrder is used when the seller try to store Mat so you make one when you want to Deliver to the warehouse . and also its used when the Ship try to like take matriles from the warehouse we look at the PurchaseOrder to see what can we give and also can we give it.
