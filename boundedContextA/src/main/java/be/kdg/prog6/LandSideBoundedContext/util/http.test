As a truck driver, I want to be recognized by my license plate so that the gate opens for the
 truck to enter the facility.

this is how to test the controller method.
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8091/api/appointments" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "sellerId": "6bc6f408-50d2-4ed5-95a4-7869322c2355",
    "licensePlate": "ABC1234",
    "materialType": "IRON",
    "time": "2001-11-11T11:00:00"
}'



// you create a controller to get the licneplate
//
